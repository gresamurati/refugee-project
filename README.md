# Global Refugee Migrations And Insights
<br>
This is a project that visualizes the refugee population resettled around the world through an interactive D3 map, graphs that tell us more about the demographics of today's refugees and the U.S. spending patterns on refugees.  
<br>

# Motivation
<br>
As of 2018, 70.8 million individuals have been forcibly displaced worldwide because of persecution, conflict, violence, or human rights violations, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The motivation for this project came from my own experiences as a child refugee who had escaped a war in 1999, and wanted to find new insights about today's refugee migration patterns. 

<br>
# What was used
<br>
